## Updating to this Release

This release includes the Wireless Library, which operates on the internal Cortex M4 in SoC Mode.

## Features and Bug Fixes

- Added support for command line interface application (cli_demo).
- IOSTREAM support has been integrated into GSDK 4.3.1.

## Known Issues

- I2C High-Speed mode is not working as expected.
- SSI bitrate above 10 Msps is not working as expected.
- DUT is getting hanged while continuously publishing data in the embedded MQTT application during power save mode.
- BLE notification and Continuous BG scan are not working as expected.
- On BRD4325B A02 boards, BLE radio's range is 4-5m.
- Intermittent Bus thread hang issue with LWIP external stack.
- The "Browser File Viewer" plugin has issues. It can't render the last image included in the markdown files and has observed issues accessing some hyperlinks.

### SOC

- In SoC mode, M4 power save will only work with the 384k TA and 320 M4 memory configuration. It is not supported for "448K TA and 256k M4" and "512k TA and 192k M4" memory configurations.

### Wi-Fi

- WPA3 connection takes 2.5 seconds more than WPA2 connection.
- An issue has been observed with WPA2 Enterprise Connectivity using Microsoft RADIUS Server.

### Network Stack

### BLE

- For BLE, dual role scenario issues might occur when connecting as central if the advertising is also going out for the peripheral role. Central connections can be made after the peripheral connections are established and advertising is stopped.
- LMP timeout BLE disconnection has been observed with the latest Realme mobile handsets.

## Limitations and Unsupported Features

### Wi-Fi/Network Stack Limitations

- Throughput is not on par with WiSeConnect 2 in the present release.
- A maximum of 3 SSL connections is supported in WiFi alone mode.
- TWT is not verified in Coex mode.
- BGscan is not verified with the TWT feature.

### SoC Limitations

- SIO currently supports SPI and UART.
- Peripherals currently use UDMA CMSIS driver.

### BLE Limitations

- For BLE, simultaneous roles (i.e., Central + Scanning and Peripheral + Advertising) are not supported if the connection is established with a small connection interval (less than 15 ms).
- BLE supports a maximum of two concurrent connections, which can be either a connection to two peripheral devices, one central and one peripheral device, or two central devices.
- The BLE Slave latency value is valid up to 32 only.

#### Unsupported Features

- SNI (HTTPS, TLS/SSL).
- Keep Alive configurability.
- Console application for customers.
- Multi-threading support for relevant APIs.
- 917-specific features (debugging utilities).
- APIs for Crypto Hardware (ECDH, DH, SHA, AES), Calibration software & stats.
- SoC Support (Hosted mode): support for switching between internal & external stack in SS.
- Protocols Offload mode: HTTP Server (917 specific), DHCPv6 Server, SNMP, Socket reads up to 64k, POP3, DTLS, mDNS, Web Socket, DNS Server.
- Power save support (Message-based).
- PTA Coexistence with other wireless.
- Baremetal support.
- Asynchronous socket APIs.
- NCP support (SPI, SDIO, UART, Linux, 3rd-party hosts).
